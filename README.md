# Voice-AI-GUI
Voice AI Assistant is a GUI-based smart assistant built in Python that allows users to interact with their computer using voice commands. It supports voice input using speech_recognition and responds with text-to-speech via pyttsx3. The interface is created with Tkinter, making the assistant visually interactive and user-friendly.
